List of Tools:

FileCompare: Compare two files, showing first and offsets of mismatches, or compare all files in a path to each other, or compare all files in a path, while deleting duplicates.

FilenameMixUpper: Scramble all the file names in a directory by renaming them to each others.

FileSplitter: Split a file into numbered parts of a given size.  See also NumberedFilesCombiner

HttpClient: Single web page GETter.  Probably more useful as an embedded class.

ImageCopy: Similar to DD, allows you to make an image file from a device.

InFileFind: Find where/at what offset a file appears inside another file

NumeredFilesCombiner: Combine a directory of files with numbered-filenames back into a single file.

PassCrypt: A tool for password-encrypting a file, which can be read and/or added to and re-encrypted

PlayKlondike: A little experiment in discovering the number of winnable klondike solitaire games.

RecursiveUnzip: Unzip all the zip files in a directory tree, with optional filename mangling

Rename: A mass-file renamer.  Possibly the most useful tool in here.

RLETool: A file compressor/decompressor using run-length-encoding, which is optimal for files with lots of repeating character blocks.

SimilarFileFinder: Discover which files in a path are most similar to a given file or path of files.  Probably the second most useful tool here.
